Duolingo is an android app that can be used to learn languages. 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 
‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòç

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Pick an app screenshot to duplicate
  - Be sure to add the screenshot to "Chosen Screenshot" below.
- [X] Create a runnable app that displays an Animal Version of your chosen screenshot
- [X] Layout uses one (1) or more ConstraintLayout
- [X] Layout uses one (1) or more ImageView
- [X] Layout uses three (3) or more TextViews

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Create a custom-shape Button using Shape Drawables
- [ ] Customize the text fonts by creating new Font Resources
- [ ] Add Tooltips to your Views to help users understand how to navigate the UI
- [X] Create a second layout, this time for an original, personal app idea

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you added to improve the app!
- I added another layout with is the first one.

## Original App Layout (Optional Stretch Feature)

Here is my entry for the "Create a second layout, this time for an original, personal app idea" stretch feature:

It is for an app that I decided to create a main screen where the user sees when they first start the app.
It is my main idea, so I did not copy from anywhere

## Notes
I learned how to display the current time.
